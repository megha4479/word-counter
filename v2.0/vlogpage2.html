<pre><p></font>You’re writing your first novel, and you know you must shoot for
around 80 to 95 thousand words.Once you know what your book will be 
about,it’s time to start planning the structure of the story. What
will happen in each chapter, and how much has to happen before you
move on to the …</p></pre>

<pre><p>No, we’re not talking about “homework,” “responsibility” or anything else 
that implies you’ll have to make an enormous effort when you’d rather be doing
something else. Instead, we’re talking about words that give you a feeling 
of real disgust. They’re perfectly ordinary,otherwise-innocuous-seeming
words, but researchers have found when study participants are asked to rate …</p></pre>

<br>
<pre><p>Love has been described as “A Many Splendored Thing” in poems (William Waterway),
in films (1955), and in Academy Award winning songs (lyrics Paul Francis Webster).
The same descriptive phrase has been used for a TV soap opera. “A Many Splendored
Thing” originated in a poem by late 19th century poet, Francis Thompson. He was …</p></pre>

<h1>What is National Word Day?</h1>

<pre><p>There seems to be a day for just about everything. I wouldn’t be in the
least bit surprised if I came across National Let’s Eat Takeout Day, and
I’d probably support it if it existed. Earth Day is real enough, but why
only one day? Shouldn’t we make every day Earth Day? Maybe we wouldn’t …</p></pre>

<pre><p>Are you writing a song? Would you like it to be really catchy? Why not go with what works
for everyone, and use the most popular words found in hit songs? If you’re wondering
whether there actually are words that songwriters continually resort to, it won’t take
you long to hit on the word “love.” …  



Owing to the stiff critique my first ever song lyric faced, I decided to look for other words that are popular in songs.
If I can find enough, I can make a song generator. You know: list of first lines, list of second lines, list of third
lines – join the dots between them and combine them anyhow you like, and voila! One perfect song lyric. And in case
you’re wondering, I’ve seen it done, and it works!

<h1>Is English the Hardest Language to Learn?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<pre><p>When we try to decide which language is the hardest to learn, we have a
problem. Everything, but everything, is subjective. There are a lot of factors
that contribute to language learning difficulties. Broadly, we could sum these
up as: The language(s) you grew up speaking Your attitude Your personal context 
If you grew up …</p></pre>
