## Project Introduction
The title of our project is “WORD COUNTER”. This project has been done by a group of three members naming Mayank, Mehak, and Megha with distinct responsibilities each. With our perpetual efforts, we were able to complete this project according to evaluations.

The purpose of a ‘word counter’ project is to count the number of words in a given text or document. The goal is typically to provide a simple and convenient tool for users to determine the word count in their content.

This can be very useful for various applications such as writing essays, reports, or blog posts where word limit or specific word counts are important. Word counters help users like us to keep track of their writing progress and ensure they meet specified guidelines.

## Technical Details
1. **HTML & CSS:** In our project, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap have played a major role. It provided a structure of our web page and the distinct blog pages, as well as defining the layout and organization of the content in the same.
2. **CSS:** CSS helped us in making our word counter interface visually appealing with custom fonts, colors, and layouts. We also learned various new tags, for example: flex, position, border, style, margin, display, etc.
3. **JavaScript:** JS is used to parse the input text. It is responsible for implementing the logic to count the words within the provided text. Technically, it is essential for creating a dynamic word counter project.

## Key Features
- **A place to type:** You need a space where you can type or paste the words you want to count.
- **Count Display:** It shows you the number of words you’ve written.
- **Magic with JS:** Behind the scenes, there’s a special code that watches what you’re typing.
- **Nice looks:** Blog pages can look nice with colors and styles using CSS and components of Bootstrap. It’s like making it look presentable.
- **Easy for everyone:** It should be easy for everyone to use, including people who use special tools to access the internet.
