            <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;>Writing is like trying to juggle flaming knives while riding a unicycle – it requires skill, precision, and a healthy dose of madness. But even the most seasoned writers can get a little lost in the word jungle, and typos and grammatical blunders can sneak up on them like ninjas in the night.So, without further ado, let’s take a look at the top 10 most difficult-to-spot writing mistakes that even the sharpest writers sometimes struggle to catch!</P>

    <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;>The easiest way is to pick and follow a style guide.

        There are many style guides for English: AP, APA, CMOS (a.k.a., Chicago), MLA, Oxford … It depends what country you’re writing for and what you’re writing about. If you’re writing within a school or company, you may be asked to follow what’s called a house style guide, that is, a guide created specifically for that entity. Some newspapers like The Economist or The Guardian even stick to their own.</P>

            <H3 STYLE="COLOR:PURPLE;"><B> 2.<U>USE THE ACTIVE VOICE:</U></B></H3>
            <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;>In English, sentences typically follow the subject–verb–object pattern: “Emilio caught the ball.” This sentence is written in the active voice, meaning the subject is acting on the object.

                However, you could also write, “The ball was caught by Emilio.” This sentence conveys the same idea, but it’s written in the passive voice. The object has become the subject.
                
                Although there are cases in which passive voice can work well or even better than the active voice, most of the time, active voice is usually preferable. Why?
                
                For one thing, the active voice takes more words to say the same thing. If you’re keen to keep your readers’ eyes from tiring or save space, active voice rules.
                
                Additionally, passive voice can sound vague. Take, for example, the following sentence: “The vase was smashed.”
                
                Who exactly smashed the vase? We don’t know. That’s why the passive voice is used in certain instances where the writer wants to eliminate tagging a subject with responsibility. Examples include law and science.</P>
                <H4 STYLE="COLOR:BROWN;FONT-SIZE:20PX;"><B> 3.<U>PUNCTUATE RIGHT:</U></B></H4>
                <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;>Punctuation marks can make a huge difference in meaning when stringing words together in a sentence. But getting punctuation right can be tricky.</P>
                <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;>Although you probably learned the basics of punctuation in grade school, there’s more to the marks than what you likely learned. That’s because like most aspects of the English language, punctuation is both art and science.</P>
                <P STYLE=FONT-SIZE:20PX;><B><U>Here’s a list of the basics:</U></B>

                </BR><B>Apostrophes</B> make contractions and show possession.

</BR>
</BR>
</BR>
</BR><B>Commas</B> indicate pauses between words, phrases, and ideas. There’s an ongoing debate between people who prefer serial, or Oxford, commas and people who don’t. The important thing is to pick an approach and stick to it.
