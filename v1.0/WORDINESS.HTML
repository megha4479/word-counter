                <P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">When reading, nothing is more annoying than a pompous text cluttered with redundant expressions. Take a look at this post for a comprehensive list of common cases of wordiness and what you can use instead.</P>
                <P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">Creative writing offers a little more leeway with the use of language.

                </BR>Depending on the genre in question, the setting of a story (fictional or real), or the character, flowery phrases may be appropriate to convey authenticity.
                    
            </BR>Song lyrics require an occasionally awkward turn of phrase to keep a line’s length and beat consistent with the others. The same goes for poetry in general.
                    
        </BR>Most other writing―be it journalism, business writing, or web writing―lends itself to a spare, even Spartan, style.
                    
    </BR>Unless a reader wants to be transported to another world, they probably just want you to get to the point. It’s not that they don’t want to hear what you have to say; it’s that they DO want to hear you. Right away.
                    
                    Sandwiching your message between unneeded verbiage helps no one. It doesn’t make you sound smarter, clearer, or more persuasive. It’s. Just. Noise.
                    
                </BR>The next time you sit down to write, the burning question running through your mind after each period should be, “Do I really need to tell them this?”</P>
