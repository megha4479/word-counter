                Who vs. Whom
                
                Who or whom? The question trips up even grammar-lovers. And in many circles, whom is becoming obsolete, which may sadden grammar purists. Although who and whom are similar, each serves a distinct purpose. In order to understand how to use these pronouns correctly, you’ll have to refresh yourself on sentence structure. Once you’ve got this …

                <H2 STYLE="FONT-SIZE:25PX;"><U>Parts of a sentence: a quick refresher</U></H2>
                <P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">The basic parts of a sentence are the subject and the predicate. The predicate must include a verb but may also include an object.

                </BR>The subject is the person or thing that acts. The verb describes the action. The object is the person or thing that’s acted upon by a verb or preposition.
                    
            </BR>Clearly, sentences can get far more complicated than this. But this is the basic structure of a sentence.
                    
        </BR>In English, the standard order of a declarative sentence, or statement, is subject—verb—object. For example:-
        
               
            
            <H2 STYLE="FONT-SIZE:25PX;"><U> WHO</U></H2>
            <P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">Who is a pronoun that replaces or refers to the singular or plural subject of a sentence. Who can be used in a question or a statement.

            </BR>This famous book title by Stieg Larsson includes who:
                
        </BR>“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest”
                
    </BR>Now, look at this headline:
                
</BR>“Couple who missed Royal Caribbean cruise in viral video was celebrating honeymoon”
</BR>Fox News
                
</BR>Here are some other examples of how to use who in a sentence:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?</LI>
    <LI>I WONDER WHO'S AT THE DOOR</LI>
    <LI>WHO WANTS TO GO SWIMMING?</LI>
    <LI>TELL ME WHO DID THIS</LI>
</UL>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">Now, let’s go back to our original examples and use who to form a question from each statement.</P>
<UL STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">
    <LI>Who bought the pizza? (Who replaces “Tyrone.”)</LI>
    <LI>Who likes Jorge? (Who replaces “Maria.”)</LI>
    <LI>Who’s watching TV? (Who replaces “my children.”)</LI>
    <LI>Who are your neighbors? (Who replaces “the Kahdims,” the subject—not “neighbors,” the object.)</LI>
    <LI>Who called the police? (Who replaces “our boss.”)</LI>
</UL>
<H2 STYLE="FONT-SIZE:25PX;"><U> WHOM </U></H2>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20PX;">Whom is a pronoun that replaces the singular or plural object of a sentence. Whom can be used in a question or a statement.

</BR>One of the most famous uses of whom is in this classic book title by Ernest Hemingway:
    
</BR>“For Whom the Bell Tolls”
    
</BR>Now, look at this headline:
    
</BR>“A Singer for Whom Words Always Came First”
</BR>The New York Times
    
</BR>Right away, you can probably sense a difference between whom and who, even if you can’t put your finger on it.
    
</BR>In these two examples, whom is followed by a preposition, but this isn’t always the case. With a direct object, a preposition isn’t necessary.
</BR>Let’s look at using whom in a sentence. Here are some examples:</P>
